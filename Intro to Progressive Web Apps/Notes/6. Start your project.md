# Start Your Project

It's time for you to start working on your own weather app. We've given you a bit of a head start and created the basic app shell, styles, and initial JavaScript for you. See the instructor notes below for information on how to download and get your development environment set up.

Because we'll be working with a service worker in a bit and service workers do not work when served from the file system, make sure that you're working from a local web server in your development environment. See the instructor notes for some more ways to do this.

Service workers must be served over HTTPS. But to make development easier, that requirement is waived when they're served from local host. When you've got everything setup properly, your app should be displayed on the browser (blue navigation bar with title "Weather PWA", refresh button and add button on top, and white screen with loading icon below).

Be sure to compare your app in the link to the instructor notes below to make sure everything works exactly the same.

## Instructor notes
You can get the project's application code from `1-12-skeleton` folder in **[this course's Github repository](https://www.github.com/udacity/ud811)**.

If you don't already have a web server installed to serve your project from, the **[Web Server for Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)** can make this simple to do.
