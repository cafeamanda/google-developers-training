# Update Your Project

There are two parts to this task.

1. Simulate the server injecting the initial weather forecast into the app.js file. You can copy the initial weather forecast data from the instructor notes bellow.

2. Modify the code to display the weather data as soon as the app loads.

When you're done, the app should load quickly and immediately display the initial weather data.

And, don't forget to try your app in multiple browsers. Be sure to compare your app to the link in the instructor notes below, to make sure it works exactly the same.

## Instructor notes

The initial weather data, as found in `1-22/app.js` in [this project's GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/udacity/ud811) is:

```
var injectedForecast = {
    key: 'newyork',
    label: 'New York, NY',
    currently: {
      time: 1453489481,
      summary: 'Clear',
      icon: 'partly-cloudy-day',
      temperature: 52.74,
      apparentTemperature: 74.34,
      precipProbability: 0.20,
      humidity: 0.77,
      windBearing: 125,
      windSpeed: 1.52
    },
    daily: {
      data: [
        {icon: 'clear-day', temperatureMax: 55, temperatureMin: 34},
        {icon: 'rain', temperatureMax: 55, temperatureMin: 34},
        {icon: 'snow', temperatureMax: 55, temperatureMin: 34},
        {icon: 'sleet', temperatureMax: 55, temperatureMin: 34},
        {icon: 'fog', temperatureMax: 55, temperatureMin: 34},
        {icon: 'wind', temperatureMax: 55, temperatureMin: 34},
        {icon: 'partly-cloudy-day', temperatureMax: 55, temperatureMin: 34}
      ]
    }
  };

```
