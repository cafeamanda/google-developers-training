# Design the App Shell

Service workers imply some subtle changes in application architecture. Rather than squashing all of your application into an HTML string, we need to do things AJAX style: **request the data asynchronously from the server and then update the local DOM to match.** This is where you have a shell that's always cast and can always boost up without the network. And the content that is refreshed regularly and managed separately.

So what goes into the application shell? The first step is to break the design down into its core components. Ask yourself,

• What needs to be on screen immediately?
• What other UI components are key to our app?
• What supporting resources are needed for the app shell? For example, JavaScript, Styles, etc.
