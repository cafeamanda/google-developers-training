# Why use an App Shell

To test this architecture on real devices, let's use [**WEB**PAGETEST](www.webpagetest.org) to take a look at the weather app that you're going to be building throughout this course.

First, let's try using a Nexus 5 on a typical cable connection.

We did a lot of work to optimize the app but it still takes 1.1 seconds until there's anything on screen. And it takes 1.9 seconds to completely render the page.

Thanks to service workers, a repeat visit achieves it's first meaningful paint after only 0.3 seconds and is finished rendering at 0.6 seconds.

What about on a slower connection? Let's try using a Nexus 5 on a typical 3G connection. The first time to meaningful paint is now 3 seconds, and it took 5 seconds until everything is finished rendering.

Here's where we really see the performance improvements of service workers. A repeat visit with service workers enabled takes only 0.3 seconds for the first meaningful paint and 0.5 seconds until it's finished rendering.

On a 3G connection using service workers, we got a ten x performance boost. The visual complete event went from 5 seconds to 0.5 seconds.

If you have users on Edge, the results are even more drastic. Instead of taking 13 seconds to complete rendering, everything is now rendered in 0.8 seconds.
