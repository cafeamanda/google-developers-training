# The Weather App Shell
We're going to put everything but the data into the weather app's shell. The HTML contains a header, an empty forecast card, a dialogue for adding new cities, and the loading indicator. Like so:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <link rel="canonical" href="https://weather-pwa-sample.firebaseapp.com/step-02/">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Weather PWA</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/inline.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <header class="header">
            <h1 class="header__title">Weather PWA</h1>
            <button id="butRefresh" class="headerButton" aria-label="Refresh"></button>
            <button id="butAdd" class="headerButton" aria-label="Add"></button>
        </header>
        <main class="main">
            <div class="card cardTemplate weather-forecast" hidden>...</div>
        </main>
        <div class="dialog-container" hidden>
            <div class="dialog">...</div>
        </div>
        <div class="loader">
            <svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" width="32" height="32">...</svg>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```
Notice that the forecast card and the dialogue are hidden by default and the loading indicator is visible.

We also need to include the style and any images our app needs to run.

When designing a more complex app, content that isn't needed for the initial load can be requested later and inCached for future use. For example, we could defer the loading of the new city dialogue until after the first run experience and we have some idle cycles available.
